    At the beginning of this year, I visited my hometown in Nepal. It had been three years since my last visit and seven years before that. 
<br>So it is needless to say my hometown has seen a lot of changes in between my visits.
There were new houses, new people and new roads to be explored. <br>Old people had gone older, and so did old houses. 
When I heard about the new road that was being dug to the top of a hill my house lays under, I had to take a look.

    One late morning I set myself for a quick hike to the top of the hill where an ancient Hindu temple stands. 
<br>It usually takes about two and a half hours for a normal Joe to get to the top. 
I had drank my last tea for the morning at my parent's house, and was ready to roll. 
I told myself I was going to complete the hike in less than two hours. Now that I think about it, it was a big mistake.

    It wasn't an easy hike, and there was no time enjoying the hike since I had to make it to the top within two hours. 
Besides the few times I stopped to take pictures, I don't remember stopping at all. The hike consisted of steep climb along a narrow path. 
The locals had raised funds to successfully construct stairs with railings at the topmost part of the hike.

    When I got to the top of the hill, I was exhausted. I thought to myself, &quot; I should have eaten something before I left.&quot; 
As soon as that thought passed through my mind, I had a nature's call. I went to the bathroom made for the temple visitors. But the bathroom had no doors, and the toilet was filled with bricks. 
My guess was that it was still under construction.
